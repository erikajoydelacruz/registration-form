# Responsive Registration Form (Treehouse Techdegree)
 
This registration form was one of the first mobile-first projects I've done. I was given a mockup to recreate for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using CSS flexbox. The mobile view is one column while tablet and desktop views are two columns.

There is no functionality to this registration form, though I do want to learn how to add form functionality to it. I learned how to create dropdown menus, how to use form labels, and how to create different form elements including inputs and buttons. 

The toughest part about this project was creating the responsive layout. In the desktop view, I had trouble spacing the label and input elements. I used percentages to size the input and add padding, but if I could do it again I would use fixed widths with media queries. 

For one of my first Techdegree projects, I think I matched the mockups pretty well. I even got an "exceeds expectations" grade because I changed different CSS properties to add custom stylings.
